# Automated Claims Frequency Analysis and Reporting Using Poisson GLM in R

ACST3061 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment focused on automated reporting and analysis of car insurance claims frequency using Poisson GLM. Included EDA, model fitting, tree/boosting methods, CV comparison, and logistic regression for high claims.

## Key Tasks
- Performed EDA and Poisson GLM with variable selection  
- Fitted Poisson regression tree and boosting models  
- Compared models via 10-fold cross-validation error  
- Applied logistic regression for high claims indicator  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R programming for automated analysis and reporting  
- Poisson GLM and tree-based methods  
- Model comparison and cross-validation  
- Reproducible data reporting and visualization
